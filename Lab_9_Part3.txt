notes:
- Vue is much less forgiving- I had an extra space and the code wouldn't display on browser at all.
- Vue has more efficient options for coding what you want.
- Vue seems more confusing to use. I like regular JavaScript better at this point. I think Vue is a shortcut/shorthand
and it can't be used as easily or efficiently by someone who doesn't understand JS well enough.
