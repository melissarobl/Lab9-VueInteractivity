Part 3, How is Vue and Vanilla JavaScript different? 2 points

What differences do you see?
In the head, the Vue script tag as been added to the HTML. That is the only difference there. The content of the HTML before the script is
largely the same, but with the addition of the 'v-model' to add the two-way binding. The ul has a bit more code in the Vue version, but only
two more lines to include the code for what happens when the button is clicked. The Vue version also has a 'div' to group the div#app elements.
The script has the most differences. The Vue app has to be set up in the Vue version. The Errors section is largely the same in each. The regular
JS version has a lot more variables and lines of code than the Vue version's counterpart script. Vue is more concise and regular JS shows more work.

Which one do you prefer? Why?

I prefer the regular JavaScript. It is clearer to me and easier to read and follow because the code is written more completely. I also think Vue is
much less forgiving. When I made small mistakes (like an extra space), the page did not render at all. Because I am learning, the way regular JS
responds to errors is better. (Though I know that using the browser's console can be helpful to finding the reason for any errors that arise in either Vue or
regular JS.) I think Vue is probably more helpful to someone who has more experience in JS and knows what it can do and therefore can use the
shorthand notation more efficiently and effortlessly.
